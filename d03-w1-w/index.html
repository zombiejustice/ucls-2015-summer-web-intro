<h1>Mr. H's Homepage</h1>
<p>Mr. H likes making dinosaur noises and teaching people about web design. Mr. H dislikes volcanos and people wearing headphones in class. Actually, he dislikes rudeness in general, not just the headphone thing. And nothing is more rude than a volcano.</p>




<p>Mr. H and Fritz are here to teach you web design, but if you have a question, remember to first ask a neighbor, and then try looking it up on w3schools, before raising your hand. Some of the things we've learned so far are:</p>


<h2>From First Week Tuesday:</h2>
<p>&lt;head&gt; defines the header part of the page, which is not seen directly by users of the webpage. It should begin right after &lt;html&gt; and end with &lt;/head&gt; right before &lt;body&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;title&gt; defines the title of the page, which is not the same as the headline. The title will be displayed at the top of the browser window! Close it with &lt;/title&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;link type='text/css' rel='stylesheet' href='FILENAME.css' /&gt; is the link element. We'll use it to link a stylesheet to our webpage. This is the first element we've learned that doesn't have a separate closing tag; that's why the tag has a slash at the end of it. Replace "FILENAME.css" with the name of your own css file.</p>
<p>{ background-color: #HEXHEX; } This is CSS, and belongs in our stylesheet (our .css file). This property will change the color of the background. Replace "HEXHEX" with the color code of your choice!</p>
<p>{ color: #HEXHEX; } This is another CSS property, which sets the color of the foreground, including text color. Replace "HEXHEX" with the color code of your choice.</p>
<p>{ font-family: "FONT1", "FONT2", FAMILY; } This CSS property sets the font to use. If the browser can't fint FONT1, it will look for FONT2, and so on down the list. The list should always end with one of the five font families: sans-serif, serif, monospace, cursive, or fantasy. There is always a default font for each of these families.</p> 
<p>{ width: SIZEpx; } This CSS property sets the width of block elements such as paragraphs and headlines.</p>
<p>{ border: SIZEpx, STYLE, COLOR; } This CSS property gives block elements a border. SIZE should be a number specified in pixels. STYLE will be the style of the border, such as solid. COLOR will be a color hex code, the color of the border.</p>
<p>{ padding: SIZEpx; } This property will put SIZE pixels between the edge or border of a block element and the text or content.</p>
<p>{ margin: SIZEpx; } This property will put SIZE pixels between the edge or border of a block element and other elements.</p>


<h2>From First Week Monday:</h2>
<p>&lt;html&gt; defines the entirity of the webpage. We end the webpage with &lt;/html&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;body&gt; defines the part of the webpage that other people (not webmasters like us) can see. We close the body with &lt;/body&gt; right before &lt;/html&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;h1&gt; defines the most important headline. &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, and &lt;h4&gt; can also be used. We can have as many of each as we want. Don't forget to close them!</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt; defines a paragraph of text, just like this one. We'll probably use these a lot!</p>
